	<h3>Welcome To Shield Options Import Wizard</h3>
	<p>Shield options import is a powerful feature that can drastically reduce the time you need to spend managing
	   your sites.</p>
	<p>You can, of course, simply use this as an ad-hoc import tool, but much more powerful is to create a
		<strong>Shield Network</strong>.</p>
	<h4>What is a Shield Network?</h4>
	<p>A Shield Network is where all your Shield Security sites are connected to a Master Site, from which they will
	derive their configuration. If you change settings on the Master Site, these will get propagated to the child sites.</p>
	<p>In the following screen, if you select the checkbox to enable Master-Child syncing, then this site will
	periodically (once a day) import settings from the Master site, overwriting any existing configuration here.</p>
	<p>Currently this is limited to options configuration, but over time we will increase the scope to include
	   IP address blocking and white lists. But you will have full control over this when the time comes.</p>
	<p>A couple of points to note:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The site from which you import (Master) must be running Shield Pro.</li>
		<li>All options on this site will be overwritten to align with that of the Master site.</li>
		<li>If you select to create the network, this site's URL will be added to the sync white list of the Master
			site, to allow for automated syncing.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Right, let's get to it. Click 'Next Step' above to start your import.

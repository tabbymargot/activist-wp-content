This blocks semalt.com, buttons-for-website.com and others with a 403 Forbidden message so that they no longer show up in your Google Analytics stats.

== Description ==

This blocks semalt.com, buttons-for-website.com and others with a 403 Forbidden message so that they no longer show up in your Google Analytics stats. This won't block ghost referrals (no plugin can do that), but [this short video](http://www.greenmellenmedia.com/blocking-ghost-referrals-in-google-analytics/) will walk you through that process in Google Analytics.

Once installed, this plugin will run automatically in the background; there is no options panel or anything to see in your dashboard.

Other sites will be added to the block list over time via updates to this plugin.

== Changelog ==

= 2.0.2 =

Fixed a bug that may have caused tracking issues for a very small percentage of sites.

= 2.0.1 =

We've now blocked from the following TLDs:
.ru .ua .cf .ga .ml .re .tk .kz .ro .pl
In addtion, we added approximately 200 more sies to the list, which are not listed here because it's getting a bit crazy. You can view the source code of the main gm-block-bots.php file to see them all.

= 2.0.0 =

We made the decision to block ALL sites on the .xyz TLD, as they are simply coming in too quickly to keep playing whack-a-mole.
In addition, we also added pogodnyyeavarii.gq, free-share-buttons.top, cpty.com, ɢoogle.com, lifehacĸer.com
Note that ɢoogle.com is the one using the strange Unicode "G" and lifehacĸer.com uses the odd Unicode "K"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Nothing changed on my site =

That is by design. This is a silent plugin, and there are no options to configure. Leave it enabled to block the bots, or disable it to let them back in.

= The bots are still getting through =

This plugin only blocks them based on their http_referer, which may not catch everything. In addition, some bots are "ghost referrals" that ping Google Analytics directly (without ever visiting your site) and the only way to stop them is via filters in Google Analytics. [This short video](http://www.greenmellenmedia.com/blocking-ghost-referrals-in-google-analytics/) will show you how to set that up.

= Can you also block another bot? =

Absolutely! We'd love to add more to the list of bots being blocked. Please email us at plugins@greenmellenmedia.com and we'll look into it.

== Screenshots ==

1. Activation link. There are no other screenshots, because the plugin works silently behind the scenes.
